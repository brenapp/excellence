              For events with a single Excellence Award, percentages are based
              on the number of teams at the event. For blended grade level
              events with two grade specific Excellence Awards, percentages are
              based on the teams in each grade level for each award.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc m-4">
              <li>
                Under certain conditions, at “blended” events which combine both
                grade levels (middle school and high school for V5RC, elementary
                school and middle school for VIQRC, and high school and
                university for VAIRC), one Excellence Award per grade level may
                be awarded. This is determined by the Qualifying Criteria. In
                the instance of two grade level specific Excellence Awards being
                given out at an event, teams are only compared to teams of the
                same grade level. This includes quantitative event data, such as
                rankings. When only one Excellence Award is given out for an
                event with multiple grade levels, all teams are considered
                together without regard for their grade level.
              </li>
              <li>
                For example, in a 24-team blended event with a single Excellence
                Award, 40% of 24 teams would be 9.6, which rounds up to 10
                teams. To be eligible for Excellence, a team would need to be
                ranked in the top 10 in the event for the above performance
                metrics to be eligible for the Excellence Award. If the event
                had 12 teams of each grade level, thus meeting the requirements
                for two grade level specific Excellence Awards, then 40% of 12
                teams comes out to 4.8, which rounds up to 5. In this instance,
                teams would need to be ranked 5th place or higher within their
                grade level in the above performance metrics to be eligible for
                the grade level specific Excellence Award.
